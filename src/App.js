  const lyrics = `[00:02.00] There once was a ship that put to sea
  [00:05.00] The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea 
  [00:08.00] The winds blew up, her bow dipped down 
  [00:10.00] Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh) 

  [00:13.00] Soon may the Wellerman come
  [00:15.00] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
  [00:18.00] One day, when the tonguing is done
  [00:20.00] We'll take our leave and go
  
  [00:23.00] She'd not been two weeks from shore
  [00:25.00] When down on her a right whale bore
  [00:28.00] The captain called all hands and swore
  [00:30.00] He'd take that whale in tow (huh)
  
  [00:33.00] Soon may the Wellerman come
  [00:35.00] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
  [00:38.00] One day, when the tonguing is done
  [00:40.00] We'll take our leave and go
  
  [00:43.00] Da-da-da-da-da
  [00:45.00] Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
  [00:48.00] Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
  
  [00:53.00] Before the boat had hit the water
  [00:55.00] The whale's tail came up and caught her
  [00:58.00] All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
  [01:00.00] When she dived down low (huh)â€¦
  
  [01:03.00] Soon may the Wellerman come
  [01:05.50] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
  [01:08.00] One day, when the tonguing is done
  [01:10.00] We'll take our leave and go
  
  [01:12.00] No line was cut, no whale was freed
  [01:15.00] The captain's mind was not of greed
  [01:18.00] And he belonged to the Whaleman's creed
  [01:20.00] She took that ship in tow (huh)

  [01:23.00] Soon may the Wellerman come
  [01:25.00] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
  [01:28.00] One day, when the tonguing is done
  [01:30.00] We'll take our leave and go

  [01:33.00] Da-da-da-da-da
  [01:35.00] Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
  [01:38.00] Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

  [01:42.00] For forty days or even more
  [01:45.00] The line went slack then tight once more
  [01:48.00] All boats were lost, there were only four
  [01:50.00] But still that whale did go (huh)

  [01:53.00] Soon may the Wellerman come
  [01:55.00] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
  [01:58.00] One day, when the tonguing is done
  [02:00.00] We'll take our leave and go

  [02:03.00] As far as I've heard, the fight's still on
  [02:06.00] The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone
  [02:07.00] The Wellerman makes his regular call
  [02:10.00] To encourage the captain, crew and all (huh)

  [02:13.00] Soon may the Wellerman come
  [02:15.00] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
  [02:18.00] One day, when the tonguing is done
  [02:20.00] We'll take our leave and go

  [02:23.00] Soon may the Wellerman come
  [02:25.00] To bring us sugar and tea and rum
  [02:28.00] One day, when the tonguing is done
  [02:30.00] We'll take our leave and go
